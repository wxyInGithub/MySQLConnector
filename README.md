# MySQLConnector
~~a library used as the connector between mysql and cpp which is based on cmake and Windows Operation System~~
~~# !!!  Don't forget to mkdir a build folder and copy the libmysql.dll from MySQL Server X.X/lib into it  !!!~~
# FUCK YOU WINDOWS!!!
Okay guys, I have totally realized one thing which is
# WINDOWS IS A WHOLE SHIT THAT NOBODY SHITTER THAN IT!!!

Generally speaking, this is a library which can easily connect mysql and C++.
# AND YOU'D BETTER RUN IT ON UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
